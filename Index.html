<div class="text">
<P>The old adage ‘measure twice, cut once.’ While it might be a cliché, in the project management world it 
    takes on a critical meaning: Choosing to rush through or ignore the project planning process can be a formula for failure.
    Pick any major event or trip and think about the time, energy and work put into making sure everything went off without a hitch. 
    Then think about the stress and aggravation you experienced those times when things didn’t go as planned.
    As a discipline, project management works the same way, except on a greater scale and involving many stakeholders 
    and a larger pool of resources. It can include external vendors, several other internal and intra-departmental team 
    members (as well as their schedules and input), additional parameters like cost, quality, timing, constant coordination, 
    communication and associated risks. Tools like Trello helps in planning to create a website. It gives a comprehensive view of 
    the projects handled.

<h2 id="c5">4. Risks Involved</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>You aren't looking hard enough if you don't find risks involved in the projects. A good project will have risks that needs to addre
</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting satisfied with the start and not actively pursuing other opportunities.</li>
<li>Not engaged with the upcoming and potential activities.</li>
<li>Not updating the organisation with latest technology</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="c6">5. Choosing the right technology for the right project</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>The first thing one should do is to understand the business needs of the client. This helps in determining the kind of technology to be used
    In other words to choose a technology you need to know “why” your client needs the project, and not only“what” that project has to do.
    What” a project does it’s not just a bunch of user stories, but it’s to understand all the relations between the software and the 
    people (not only the users) involved.
    So, in nutshell, how to choose the right technology for the right job? Simple. Just ask the right questions to your client.
    And remember that choosing a technology, like the most of the problems in software development, it’s all about people!

<h2 id="c8">7. Legal Guidelines</h2>

style="width:600px;height:200px;">
<div class="text">
<P>The internet has drastically changed the way we communicate and handle everyday tasks. There is a risk of
    getting an individual's personal data getting shared with the third party dealers. None can imagine the amount of personal
    data that has been shared in the internet. Though it remains open to public, one doesn't realize how it can compromise.
    Companies tell that they collect this type of information so that they can serve in a better manner, offer more targeted 
    and relevant communications, all to provide customers with a better experience.</P>

<P>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation"target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation</a> has been implemented 
    in all local privacy laws across the entire EU and EEA region. It will apply to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in 
    Europe, including companies on other continents. GDPR gives more security to citizens of the EU enabling them to have greater 
    control over their personal data and assurances that their information is being securely protected across Europe.
